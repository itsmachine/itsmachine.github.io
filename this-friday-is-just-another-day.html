  <h1> This friday is just another day</h1>	</div>

<p>Secretly, fridays have always been the days I hated the most.</p>
<p> I take fridays as I take airplanes and trains: a suffocating place in time where you are compelled to experience and wonder about existence.</p>
<p>For me, what happens in a Friday night is the logical conclusion, or symbolic representation, of one's experience of life.</p>
<p>And my logical conclusion had mostly been one of an alienating and unescapable boredom and loneliness.</p>
<p>The reason was simple. Alhough epicurean, I always took joissance as a fundamental value in my life. Each drop of sweat, each email sent, these were all for the expectation of never-ending pleasure and consumption.</p>
<p>It was unavoidable: on fridays, I had to find enjoyment and pleasure; I had to justify the sweat and reassure joissance as the fundamental value of life.</p>
<p>I could never do it.</p>
<p>Okay, only once.</p>
<p>Still, today is strange - one I never experienced, I had to document it.</p>
<p>I feel lonely, maybe melancholic, but there's no suffocating alienation screaming down the throats of existence.</p>
<p>Perhaps, I'm getting old, and old people just like to sleep.</p>
<p>Perhaps, I'm strong and wiser enough for loneliness and patience.</p>
<p>Perhaps, I'm experiencing something real, plastics would likely evaporate.</p>
<p>Regardless, I'm finally finding the right use of my sweat.</p>
<p>Regardless, today is a happy day.</p>
<p>It is a happy day because it's strange.</p>
<p>It's strange because this friday is just another day.</p>
