  <h1> On forgiveness</h1>
<p>Forgiveness has always been the one virtue I was never able to accept - it almost offended me.</p>
<p>It never made sense why a loving God would enable horrors, degeneracy, deceit, and later compel a victim to bow down to the perpetrators.</p>
<p>This always infuriated me, still does, but the sparkles and glaze of life are starting to show&nbsp;me what's behind this formidable idea.</p>
<p>Today, I remembered the individuals that harmed and humiliated me the most, and I wasn't sure whether I wanted to destroy or thank them.</p>
<p>Although they caused me extreme pain and tears in the past, this blatantly led me towards the golden rivers I swim at the moment.</p>
<p>Surely, I'll always be bitter and spit on them, but...</p>
<p>Perhaps, toxic classmates were essential to propel me towards&nbsp;the becoming of the self.</p>
<p>Perhaps, oppressive schoolgirls kept me away from ephemeral, plastic and degenerate relationships.</p>
<p>Perhaps, &nbsp;ambitious and unethical co-founders were the best remedy to never become like them.</p>
<p>Perhaps, an unstable family was necessary to make me understand what an absolute is all about.</p>
<p>Perhaps, these tragedies were the only way to map a distinctive road, to get to the higher mountains.</p>
<p>Perhaps, forgiveness is not about forgiving a person, but God himself.</p>
