  <h1> Searchlights</h1>
  <p>And as the night goes, few words are spoken or seen.<br />I am a poor man, with just a few lamps.<br />It can be silent, and lonesome, and tricky, but it's the highway I was given, the one I am.<br />A small circle I might have, few companions might be seen: quiet, yet very bright.<br />Indeed, as the time comes, no darkness can be seen.<br />That's the price and the tradeoff for wholeheartedness, truthfulness, and that shall be.<br />I was born to see diamonds, simplify, minimize, and focus on what matters.<br />Focus on who matters.<br />If a tree I am, I don't have Christmas lights.<br />All over. Chatting. Laughing. Lying. Partying.<br />It'd be sad: a tiny light in each corner, yet, so dark, so empty, you can't see your own toes.<br />A tree surrounded by rice and chicken. Tasteless. Numb.<br />I was lucky on the way to born.<br />The tree I am, I perhaps have four searchlights, but this light gets much farther.<br />It's more quiet, silent, but bright, colorful, tasteful.<br />In the silence, I have myriad echoes of the light I'm given, back and forth, and back and forth,...<br />In there, I get to experience the most thorough and formidable tastes of this world.<br />It takes time for a single searchlight, and you never know where it's coming. <br />It's not up to you. <br />You just need to accept, and embrace them, and love them.<br />But it's exactly this risk, this chaos, this intensity, that makes it is so rare, so extraordinary.</p>
