  <h1> Vivid dream</h1>
  <p>Where am I? It is a familiar place, with trees, dirt roads, and butterflies.</p>
<p>The Sun is sucking me in, so pleasurable. I look at my cellphone, butterflies dance, and I can't believe the great things to watch, the things to happen.</p>
<p>Yet, I remembered. There is a weird feeling inside me. I don't wanna do much, just enough. It is fear, but that's it. I don't know why.</p>
<p>Then I look at my sister, and her tears and begin to fall.</p>
<p>"He died."</p>
<p>I am confused. I am angry. I am sad.</p>
<p>The tears were the sun burning my eyes.</p>
<p>Why had to change? why be like this? I hate this place, sun explode and take it all away, how did he go? why did he have to go? why do we all have to...</p>
<p>I wanna know everything! I wanna remember everything! I wanna change....</p>
<p>Weak, I crouch, a white hole comes. It sucks me in, repeating, over and over:</p>
<p>"I will erase it. Each story is a story. Let it go, be yourself, free. Make of this be the one."</p>
<p>It's dark. I wake up.</p>
<p>Where am I? In front of a computer, nice. Beautiful office.</p>
<p>Around, I see people moving, they seem to smile, to respect me even, submit.</p>
<p>"We did it", I hear. "I did it", it seems.</p>
<p>My infantile dreams are helping people. That's strange. The sun is blinding; the coffee, fresh; my eyes, finally smiling. "Let's meet the investor", I hear.</p>
<p>Yet, I remembered. There is a weird feeling inside me. I don't wanna do much, just enough. It is fear, but that's it. I don't know why.</p>
<p>Then I look at my hands, they have grass, oh my god, I remember now, my grandfather died, but why?, what happened, why am I here?, why is this happening, what if this is gonna wrong?, I think this investor is gonna...</p>
<p>I wanna know everything! I wanna remember everything! I wanna change....</p>
<p>Weak, I crouch, a white hole comes. It sucks me in, repeating, over and over:</p>
<p>"I will erase it. Each story is a story. Let it go, be yourself, free. Make of this be the one."</p>
	<p>It's dark. I wake up</p>	
<p>Where am I? And so it happens again. And again.</p>
<p>5 or 6 times. Over and over. Story over story. I reincarnated and died.</p>
<p>The fog is big, and the memories from the dream, well, they shouldn't be here, so I'm glad some remained.</p>
<p>Time by time, bad memories and fear would mercilessly turn the lights off. It was the cycle. An iteration of an iteration.</p>
<p>Then for the last time, and I don't know why, but that was the saddest and most intense.</p>
	<p> The dream had to teach me. It was cold and calculated, there was no other way </p>	
<p>My whole body was crying, I never was so weak.</p>
<p>The white hole told me the same thing:</p>
<p>"I will erase it. Each story is a story. Let it go, be yourself, free. Make of this be the one."</p>
<p>But this time, with all the pain, I knew what it meant.</p>
<p>I knew what I had to do.</p>
<p>I knew I was right.</p>	
<p>When you have love, when you have light, don't hold a thing back. Give all yourself, just let it ride.</p>
<p>Where am I? I don't care, I don't know. I don't think. I just and go and hug her. And kiss her. And kiss her. And kiss her.   </p>
