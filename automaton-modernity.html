  <h1> Automaton Modernity</h1>
  <p>Modernity is an Automaton.</p>
<p>The current time is an unmatched river in spacetime.</p>
<p>Objectively, positively or not, Modernity has been the&nbsp;actual and contemporary&nbsp;solvent and catalyst that turned nearly all universals, essences and abstracts into quantifiable atoms, sharing no bonding properties other than correlation which,&nbsp; by itself, presents itself as an empty placeholder.</p>
<p>Modernity was the child of other mechanisms, Nominalism denying the existence of Universals, Protestanism as the predecessor conveys differentiation, productization and, of course, atomization of theological truth.</p>
<p>With&nbsp;an apparent unexplainable catalyst, the past thousand years of mankind have been an incessant wave of non-essentialism, deconstruction, relativism. Innevitably taking to both relativism, nihilism and skepticism.</p>
<p>It's the work of real scientists and engineers to reassemble the minicule particles and&nbsp;reconstitute that which&nbsp;once was the Human. From the ashes, build the castles to the skies.</p>
<p>Each bridge and building has its own details, it's the work of the specialist to investigate the implementations, but I will just reassess the general architecture.</p>
<p>Not all was yet deconstructed and taken to its extremist and endless void, but, if it did, below the ashes, it'd be blatant to see&nbsp;metal flesh and bones that no coersive and ideological process could ever&nbsp;had liquidated. In the logistics and properties of the deconstructive linguistic mechanism, it lives&nbsp;the essential and immortal embodiment of what it'd fought all along.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was always a heart in the core of the destructive&nbsp;automaton, but, instead of recognizing its own rhythm and truth, it chose to destroy that which it had aforementioned created before Modernity.</p>
<p>This essence, namely heart, is the truthful poetic symbolization of the metaphysical and transcendental&nbsp;concept&nbsp;of Love.</p>
<p>As atoms ourselves, there's little any of our&nbsp;linguistic tools&nbsp;or actions can influence the modern automaton and the underlying sociological reflexivity it&nbsp;loathes itself with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as atoms, we can learn from Automaton's story and its unfortunate brough-forth degeneracy. At the very least, we can live and find values in the dialectial anti-thesis of what Automaton is.</p>
<p>At best, we deny our own reflexive, skeptic, nihilistic and self-destructive mechanisms, and let&nbsp;our essential hearts do its transcendental effort,&nbsp;connecting our essence to another which divinely matches and complements our lacking attributes so that we can combat the darkness and emptiness of a&nbsp;psychotic&nbsp;technocratic&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>For it is Love the one unbreakable Universal that no amount of scientific, philosophical or linguistic effort could ever destroy.</p>
<p>For it is Love which reassembles us all and harmonizes all that lacks, is broken or extremizes.</p>
<p>The story of my life is one of a machine myself, lead by Newton, Schopenhauer, Kant and Darwin himself, which by a blow of destiny, opened and&nbsp;turned the steering wheel of his heart, letting all Light, Truth, trinity, Love spring.</p>
<p>For I may be just a particle in the endless universe of meaningless, but hope lives in every action of my soul - it knows deeply love is the indestructible that connects us all.</p>
