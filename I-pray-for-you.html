  <h1> I pray for you</h1>
<p>For the love in me that remains for you, I wish God never shows you the Truth.<br />The truth of who I am, of what I truly believe, of what I always for us tried to fight and search for.<br />Indeed, I wish you never see what I always felt deep in my heart, of how far I was willing to go.<br />Indeed, I wish you never understand why I always begged in desperation for a hope of a tomorrow.<br />Indeed, I wish you never understand the pains of all those goodbyes, distances, times away and apathy that I caused nothing for.<br />Indeed, I wish you never see the truth of the ways that you treated me, and how you left me so many times, and often I was left alone on the fringe of depression, suicide, sickness.<br />Indeed, I hope God never shows you how hurt, destroyed and hopeless I became after seeing the screenshots you sent me.<br />Indeed, I hope God never shows you that I never included any other person in our relationship, that I took it as something sacred, pure, untouchable, as the most important thing in my universe.<br />Before seeing the screenshots from that loser...<br />"He understands me more than you ever did..."<br />"Mouse character..."<br />"City needs a revolution"<br />Maybe I had hope in a small part of the world, but that took away everything from me.<br />It made me expect only death and destruction from everything around me.<br />Maybe for you, seeing that wouldn't hurt.<br />Maybe, it would be normal.<br />But that destroyed me.<br />That humiliated me in the most vile way possible.<br />That made me ashamed of myself, of what I was, of what I am.<br />It took all the value and identity I have of myself, made me believe I am true fool and idiot to ever think I could love someone.<br />But, yes, I know what you're thinking now...<br />I am just victimizing myself.<br />But...<br />Maybe there's a reason why I become sometimes sarcastic?<br />Maybe it's not that I am a rat? A disgusting person? An idiot?<br />...Maybe I'm trying to hide?<br />Hiding the pain and suffering of you broking me inside entirely?<br />Maybe I was desperate trying to show you who I am, that there is no vile in me, that I am here, Ive always been.<br />No, for you, I am just victimizing myself.<br />For you, I am "brainwashed", "victimizing", "disgusting sarcasm" "sea of shit", "rats", "stupid".<br />But... maybe... my heart was just broken.<br />Many times...<br />And maybe...<br />I'm just trying to survive<br />Fooling my own brain<br />Not to believe<br />In having no longer a reason to live.</p>
