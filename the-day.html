  <h1> The day</h1>
  <p>It was 2016 and If I were to describe that one day, there wouldn't enough books for it.<br />It is clear in the top of my mind.<br />Every detail, conversation and choice was different in an unexplicable and intrinsic way.<br />The night before, why would my mother tell me all of that?<br />It was almost a cliche, telling me that all my rationality, coldness, rudeness would someday fade away and bring about a warm and loving soul.<br />I did try to dismiss, and said she was crazy, silly.<br />In my head, it was the obvious autistic pattern to be followed.<br />It would have to be another day.<br />But in my heart, I was everything: scared, excited, happy, amazed, terried. <br />I had heard of such things.<br />I never it could happen.<br />And every second of that day, it just became more intense.<br />It just became more unexplainable.<br />The foods.<br />The places.<br />The chats.<br />The car.<br />The driver.<br />The color.<br />The clothes.<br />The smell.<br />The route.<br />The weather.<br />The songs.<br />The time.<br />And then it happened.<br />The fire in her head<br />Ready consuming my eyes,<br />She was there<br />In each step of the stair<br />I felt myself higher<br />And downstair I life<br />All my preconceptions<br />All my planned conversations<br />My strategic questions<br />My hedged fear<br />They were all awed<br />Amazed<br />Dwarfed<br />I left myself with<br />All my simplicity<br />All my truth<br />And a smile<br />Because I knew<br />Knew exactly what happened<br />And at that moment<br />Everything would be better<br />The first step<br />In a blessed, divine road,<br />Everything was better<br />Everything is better<br />Everything will be better<br />And everytime I look back at that day<br />I can see the metaphors with infinite and all interpretations<br />The most formidable and complex masterpiece<br />And all the seconds<br />All the happenings and words<br />They hid prophecies<br />Divine promisses <br />And the truth<br />For our two souls<br />In the way to go<br />In the way to live<br />In the way to be.</p>
