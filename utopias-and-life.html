  <h1> Utopias and Life</h1>
  <p>Throughout the years, I was never sure of the health of my actions.</p>
<p>With time, I learned that utopias were the best way to assess the path where I was going.</p>
<p>I'd always ask myself, as an unbiased spectator:</p>
<p>"Is my utopia essentially good?"</p>
<p>And, for a long time, I became overly skeptical.</p>
<p>My utopia was having "fuck you money", buying an island, creating some robots, find a pill for immortality, then figure out what to do.</p>
<p>Escaping, surviving, hiding from the world. And I knew it was bad.</p>
<p>But I was filled with gray days, migrating through sterile meeting rooms, lonely airports, and rotten subway stations.</p>
<p>No matter how far and sophisticated, everywhere was void of life.</p>
<p>I couldn't force myself to enjoy. There was nothing to experience.</p>
<p>I couldn't speak the love language of bridges, mountains, castles, museums, rivers.</p>
<p>But, then...</p>
<p>A small bird got my eyes, we started dancing. It pushed me to fly higher and higher.</p>
<p>So high, my eyes are starting to see the dancing stars.</p>
<p>There is light, and I'm not as bitter against a dark world.</p>
<p>I don't wanna hide - there's a world that embraces who I am.</p>
<p>A world that I want to experience, feel and let it heighten my mind.</p>
<p>My hands are not alone, cold, holding a phone.</p>
<p>I find warm hands what keep me going.</p>
<p>And, perhaps, I don't know where or when I'm going.</p>
<p>But, I know I'm going.</p>
<p>I know we are going.</p>
<p>Always going.</p>
<p>Somewhere.</p>
<p>Where light lives.</p>
<p>That's my utopia.</p>
