  <h1>Childhood</h1>
  <p>I never had a choice other than living in the future. Fighting, escaping and destroying "childhood", or "childishness", has always been my greatest utopia. The nostalgia, judging stares, unescapable isolation, loud classes, and saddening laughters, combined, just rot my soul.</p>
<p>The further away I got from this, the happier I got. Still, whenever I have reencounters, through a former school colleague, or similar humiliating situation, or memory, I immediately feel entrapped by its life-sucking claws.</p>
<p>And the issue is that there's childishnesss everywhere, in all ages.</p>
<p>Today, it's the ruling ideology.</p>
<p>Slaves and masters of their own ignorance and lethargy.</p>
<p>Kids, with their egocentric megalomanic dreams, primitive emotions, delusions of authenticity. Crowding together, little gangs, poisoning souls and rivers of indolence and feeble insurgency. <br />Self-deluded one might change the world with their desires and songs. Too idealistic, ignorant and imbecile for reasoning or any real emotion. Apathetic sociopaths without any regard for anything outside their freudian instinctive urges. </p>
<p>And yet adults, with their cold, formal and competitive mechanics, are just simple to ignore, and then easy to sway. I can't fit , but I can just mind my business.</p>
	<p> There is no time for stares, no humiliations, jealousy, mind games. They first need to survive.</p>
<p>Perhaps, I will always keep a menacing yet genuine child inside, the one I never got to live, but I'm glad to see the years passing by. With all my resentment, I have build unlimited and unstoppable force against them.</p>	
<p>It may all be a fast rollercoaster, but it is one pointing up. That's what I live, that's what I see.</p>
<p>A sinoid with a positive slope.</p>
<p>I guess I was right. As time passes, metaphorically, my life turns into bourbon, not dirty water .</p>
