  <h1> Beliefs and heaven</h1>
  <<p>In this short life of mine, I didn't know completely, but I've been right, left, low, high.<br />Almost all my beliefs have been dissembled and reconstructed, back and forth.<br />For a moment, I was the messiah, the warrior, the pure, the yellow. The one, with words, songs, and preeches from God, that was gonna clean the world from all evil degeneration, and stop all impurity and vulgarity.<br />For a moment, I was a scared and betrayed little boat in an endless sea of thunderstorms, dodging from balls and spits of a demon.<br />For a moment, I was a mummy, coming apart each step that I took, struggling to keep the grains of my body.<br />But, in all these seconds, I knew where I had to go. I always felt my home.<br />I was scared, feared, lost, terrified, but I had all these feelings trying to run to the one truth, the one path.<br />The one truth that I will always believe.<br />In any and all possible dimensions and circumstances.<br />Either crying or shouting, I was fighting against my own delusions, looking for the one path.<br />The path that I don't know where it takes, or what it gives, or why I was given it. But, without any delusions, I know it's the one heaven of mine, and I need to follow it, and protect it, and be strong, and do whatever it takes, and keep ourselves together, and never give up.</p>
