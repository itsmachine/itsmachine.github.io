  <h1> My deepest desire</h1>
  <p>I will try to leave all masks behind</p>
  <p>At least for those facets presented here and</p>
  <p>Behind the curtains of my shyness</p>
<p>There lives a savage bull</p>
<p>As surely one lives in everyone</p>
<p>And If I'm to be perceived as perverse</p>
<p>May I at least be clear on my ways.</p>
<p>Behind my rationality,</p>
<p>There always lived burning desires,</p>
<p>Often misregarded by most</p>
<p>Or else very misunderstood.</p>
<p>Behind all my actions,</p>
<p>Behind all my ideas,</p>
<p>Behind all my fantasies,</p>
<p>What do I desire the most?</p>
<p>Everyone will have an answer</p>
<p>For me it's rather simple.</p>
<p>I desire what is mine,</p>
<p>Mine and mine only,</p>
<p>No one can touch,</p>
<p>No one can get close,</p>
<p>Mine and mine only.</p>
<p>In all the cues</p>
<p>All physical gifts</p>
<p>All small and tiny details</p>
<p>My mind and body burns</p>
<p>For that which yells as fully mine</p>
<p>My signature</p>
<p>My land</p>
<p>My garden</p>
<p>My home.</p>
<p>Nothing else</p>
<p>Awakens my bull</p>
<p>Nothing else</p>
<p>Really gets my desire</p>
<p>If anything gets close to what's mine</p>
<p>Even if remotely in my mind</p>
<p>My desire is not the same</p>
<p>If I am offered something many had</p>
<p>I simply find no sparkle</p>
<p>A sense of repel and disgust strikes me</p>
<p>To expose myself to that</p>
<p>Which holds the remainers of others</p>
<p>Would you kiss a sidewalk?</p>
<p>Would you touch a toilet with your sensitive parts?</p>
<p>I wouldn't either</p>
<p>But I'm smart enough</p>
<p>To see the similiarity,</p>
<p>With any drugs given</p>
<p>I would never be able to consumate</p>
<p>Because I have no desire</p>
<p>My bull is retracted</p>
<p>It simply doesn't find the whistle</p>
<p>To feed that disguting land</p>
<p>If anything</p>
<p>If I ever felt my land had been invaded by someone else</p>
<p>I'd start trying to validate my beauty</p>
<p>Mistakengly, I once used those trash humans for validation</p>
	<p>"Am I beautiful enough?"</p>
<p>To understand if I had value,</p>
	<p>It was a stupid and useless mistake</pp>	
<p>But deep inside I am uncapable</p>
<p>Often when I'm single I wish I wasn't</p>
<p>But deep in my heart</p>
<p>I can only see these people</p>
<p>As cum dumpsters</p>
<p>And I honestly feel a vomitating sensation</p>
<p>Whenever one gets close to me</p>
<p>Genocidal thoughts come through my head.</p>
<p>Regardless, deep in my heart </p>
<p>If I were to fantasize</p>
<p>With that which I desire the most</p>
<p>The only thing, in the end, I desire</p>
<p>I'd find pleasure in that which is often disregarded</p>
<p>But for me it finds all my certainty</p>
<p>The soul that I belong to</p>
<p>All of myself</p>
<p>All of my body,</p>
<p>And in such</p>
<p>The body that belongs to me</p>
<p>Each tiny detail</p>
<p>The skin that is mine with my scent</p>
<p>The hand that is made perfectly for my body</p>
<p>The mouth that is mine, clean, reserved,all for me</p>
<p>The legs that I gently kiss</p>
<p>And as such feel the smell of the water</p>
<p>Coming through the gates</p>
<p>All my water</p>
<p>All made for me</p>
<p>For my tongue, for my mouth, for my body,</p>
<p>It is clean, pure, made for me</p>
<p>Dripping through my garden</p>
<p>Scratching and carving my soul</p>
<p>The smoothness and warmthness of the skin</p>
<p>That only I have it</p>
<p>That is my home</p>
<p>Locked for myself</p>
<p>The gentleness</p>
<p>The texture made for me,</p>
<p>My flowers and tress</p>
<p>All mine, for myself</p>
<p>Beautifully combined</p>
<p>I have desire</p>
<p>I have strength</p>
<p>I have fire</p>
<p>I want to grab, hold, get her close to me</p>
<p>Burn her with the heat of my skin</p>
<p>Bites, slaps, very strong squeezes</p>
<p>Hugging</p>
<p>Grabbing</p>
<p>Taming</p>
<p>My lioness</p>
<p>Preparing her with all that is needed</p>
<p>For the ultimate climax</p>
<p>Make my lioness fly,</p>
<p>So high</p>
<p>So high</p>
<p>I have no limit</p>
<p>I go as far as I have to</p>
<p>She is mine</p>
<p>And it is my duty to give her what she desires</p>
<p>I never stop</p>
<p>I use all my strength</p>
<p>All my fire</p>
<p>And our time</p>
<p>Comes</p>
<p>I leave a part of myself in her</p>
<p>She has part of me</p>
<p>I have part of her</p>
<p>My mind can't stop racing</p>
<p>The desire is overwhelming</p>
<p>The ultimate act of ownership</p>
<p>Our bodies are flooded</p>
<p>The smell, the texture, the warmth, the final sound,</p>
<p>Everything is perfect</p>
<p>My bull absorbs it all</p>
<p>It is his</p>
<p>All his</p>
<p>He is proud, joyful, completed</p>
<p>There is nothing but contempt</p>
<p>Peace</p>
<p>Safe.</p>
<p>Since the first time I touched her body,</p>
<p>Never was I naive,</p>
<p>Or innocent or unaware of my desired and talents,</p>
<p>Indeed,</p>
<p>I think I was born with them,</p>
<p>Deep in my heart and soul,</p>
<p>It is part of my DNA,</p>
<p>I never had to learn,</p>
<p>Never did I change,</p>
<p>Never did I become unpure,</p>
<p>I always just feel it all</p>
<p>It flows from my soul to my body</p>
<p>My bull when secure of his land</p>
<p>It aggressively and instinctively comes out</p>
<p>No technique, practice or experience required</p>
<p>It all is the movement of the soul</p>
<p>The strong</p>
<p>The bold</p>
<p>The builder</p>
<p>The fertilizer</p>
<p>In my biggest desire</p>
<p>Instinctively</p>
<p>Existentially</p>
<p>Sexually</p>
<p>My biggest desire is to feel home</p>
<p>To grab, squeeze and hold</p>
<p>That land which is mine</p>
<p>And no one else gets to touch.</p>
