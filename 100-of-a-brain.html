  <h1> 100% of a brain</h1>
  <p>I see people complaining they only use 10% of their brains. They wish for a pill, or a surgery, to use 100% of it.</p>
<p>For me, I couldn't think of a more cruel torture.</p>
<p>Not for the pessimism of rationalizing existential or philosophical questions. That's not a side-effect of the intellect.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Logic is always a stairway to God, and vice-versa. Intelligence is an easier path towards enlightenment.</p>
<p>Instead, it would be a torture for the unbearable sensitivity.</p>
<p>Nobody really considers all the things that happen in a freckle of a second.</p>
<p>The pouring waters, distorted lights, the crying children, the emerging footsteps, yelling cars, the wind your hair, the emerging hunger, the obnoxious laughter, the annoying texture of clothes, the exotic spice of food...</p>
<p>Think of all of that being absorbed, processed, at the same time.</p>
<p>It may be too much... and everything seems like a bullet, hitting you right in the brain.</p>
<p>You can't focus on anything, there's only the loud jumble circling around your head.</p>
<p>It gets louder and louder until you can't hear, process, anything.</p>
<p>When that happens, I just lay around as a boat in a thunderstorm, wishfully praying it to just cool off, go away.</p>
<p>Sometimes, so very few times, I am fortunate to find an affectionate shoulder: I feel protected by a bubble, guarded against the raging storms surrounding me.</p>
	<p>A hyperenergetic and melting brain is my Achille's heel, not my essence.</p>
	<p> My resistance's getting stronger, and someday I'll completely overcome it.</p>
