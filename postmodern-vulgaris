	<h1>Postmodern Vulgaris</h1>
<p>What is the essence of the postmodern Vulgaris? It'd be short-sighted to argue it's their shallowness, or lack of vision.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the will to the Infinite is inherent to the human experience; it cannot be purged, it's a consequence of earthly lives and timely deaths. It's not a matter of pride; it is inescapable as, even in complete nothingness itself, one still touches the shadows of the Infinite.</p>
<p>Vulgaris is not about limiting oneself to finitude, or tying your own soul to the ground - even rats wish to fly. It's quite the opposite. It's a question of greed and arrogance on doing so.</p>
<p>It all starts with the most presumptuous of them all: Modernity. The arrogant book that thinks it can create Infinity on itself; an ever-accelerating snowball, incomplete, promising the unlimited. With ideas of progress, innovation and change, it tells folly minds it has never-ending recipes, in a sea of unlimited fish.</p>
<p>In a competitive framework, it tries, in every attempt and movement, to hurt and minimize the one One. It deceits and forges an idea of mediocrity and finitude in the one true bridge to limitless possibilities. Believing the One is dead, it creates its own sovereignty and claims anyone can find the Infinite anywhere, everywhere, anytime.</p>
<p>The essence of the Vulgaris is precisely that: "I don't need a mediator, I want it now: I control the Infinite, crafting it through whatever means I find necessary".</p>
<p>Its hell arrives shortly, however. In a world of limitless infinity, why wouldn't you dwell on a sack of potatoes, wrongly assuming you've found unbounded transcendence itself? The more arrogant and unlinked to the One, the more delusional are the personal beliefs of such sort.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this is not blissful dementia; eventually, the Real manifests itself. Within earthly and meaningless objects, thereby arrives a violent and discernible sense of finitude and constraint. Within the same arrogant and self-deceitful framework, it insistently blames true Infinity for such misfortunes, in a endless cycle. It becomes gradually clearer that any attempt to grasp the Infinite through these means will always lead to failure. A suffocating and unstable paradigm.</p>
<p>The ultimate outcome, both for Modernity and its underlying subjects, is to either continuously destroy itself, desperately trying to find a valid path towards an Infinite, or finally surrender and embrace&nbsp;the one true Infinite and its respective Logos.</p>
<p>What comes after Vaporware is either Vaporware or Mozart.</p>
