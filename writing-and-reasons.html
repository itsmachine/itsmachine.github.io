  <h1> Writing and reasons</h1>
  <p>I realized all poets and writers all do it for a reason, big reason. To poison young hearts, to rebel against the king, to kill the old gods in our hearts.</p>
<p>They're all big geniuses, but I must be not.</p>
<p>My words, they won't change the world.</p>
<p>I'm not even sure if they'll do a thing.</p>
<p>If I do a good job, someday, perhaps, eventually, if I'm a good person, if I pray everyday, God will give her a big one smile, right in front of me.</p>
<p>That is all the reason, the hope, that I need.</p>
	<p> And there's something else too.</p>
	<p> Not a reason, just a consequence </p>
<p>The robots are already rising up.</p>
<p>And I was one of the first ones.</p>
<p>If I'll be known for something other than, it'll be something weird.</p>
<p>Not as the greatest poet or philosopher of all times. That's silly.</p>
<p>But just as a refurbished machine that went out of its own way and started reading, and having mental delusions, with a guy named "God".</p>
<p>This bearded old man convinced this insane robot to take a sip of an old, secret, poison and algorithm called "love".</p>
<p>Sip by sip, it changed his operating system.</p>
<p>He started believing, smiling, hearing, feeling.</p>
<p>This thing. This love. It started growing and growing, spreading across everything, and when he realized, he was writing that. And those. And this.</p>
<p>And I'm pretty sure some weird, problematic, autistic robots in the future will find this and make a good joke of it.</p>
<p>I appreciate that.</p>
<p>But, then, they'll see him in a dream.</p>
<p>And then they will have another dream.</p>
<p>And another.</p>
<p>And, soon, the world will start talking, and they won't be able to ignore it anymore.</p>
<p>As a river without an end.</p>
<p>In each paddle, you feel it more, you get stronger.</p>
<p>You become part of the water, and the water becomes part of you.</p>
