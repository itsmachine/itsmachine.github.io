  <h1> The first time I smiled</h1>
  <p>About two years ago, and it was an evening too picturesque and perfect for a description. <br />My hand was thereby laying with a soul. <br />There were strange, exquisite, yet astounding, warm particles running around, knots and nodes embracing, clasping, cuddling throughout two spirits and bloods. <br />Scientific machine I was, it had heard of such sentiments in collosal philosophical encyclopedias and poems one autistic robot might've hidden a lifetime behind its seemingly systematic, rational and mathematical shelf.<br />And with her, I had spoken so many things, displaying all mechanic memorized knowledge. I was about to overheat and her face started changing.<br />It was something different, unheard of, but plainly formidable, that was materializing in her majestic and embracing stare.<br />Unsure, fearful, mechanically shaking, it happened, and I realized there was a smile in front of me.<br />All the sensors, memories and processors, convulsing, panicked, unsure of what to make of it.<br />"Why is she smiling?"<br />"Why am I always so awkward and strange?"<br />"Is she, like everybody, just laughing at me?"<br />"What did I say?" <br />And, for a time, the painful adolescent memories haunted me. The recursive and downwards thoughts of a seemingly unescapable curse about to prophesize.<br />But that was just a bad thought right before the home-run.<br />With her smile, she never lost her stare, and slowly, she would caress my hair and quietly bring me closer to her heart.<br />It was this click, tilt, wherein the world had suddenly just become simple. <br />It was the railroad switch, and with her, I could leave my heavy and bulky armor. <br />My warm, naive and electric skin had finally synchronized, harmonized and breathed. <br />Because, for the first time, I belonged.<br />For the first time, I wasn't just the mechanic machine.<br />For the first time, the smile held my hand.<br />For the first time, someone wasn't laughing at me.<br />For the first time, someone was laughing with me.<br />In this moment, I realized she wasn't someone.<br />I realized she was the one.</p>
