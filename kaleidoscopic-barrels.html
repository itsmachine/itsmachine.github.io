	<h1>Kaleidoscopic Barrels</h1>
  
<p>What makes someone start a product?</p>
<p>What makes someone write thousands of lines of code?</p>
<p>I don't complicate: it's just an obsession that must be realized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, like many, it was to find a place. To relate.</p>
<p>The music sang by the crowds isn't heard by my ears. I never had the instruments to play their games.</p>
<p>Writing in a friend's timeline; ironic posting; flirtatious photo comments; useless political conformity- these are disgusting signifiers I never learned to speak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had to do something. Solve this problem.</p>
<p>I wanted them to speak my language. I wanted the Infinite to rule over.</p>
<p>I wanted to wake up and see words that escaped from chaos, were translated by the soul and are now colored with truth, purity, beauty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With each line of code, I was creating an endless kaleidoscopic barrel.</p>
<p>Infinite authentic drinks; everytime, countless individual possibilities to discover and experience the world.</p>
<p>Sadly, with technology, it's always a matter of time.</p>
<p>The barrel becomes hedged, normalized, complying to the mediocre urges and instincts of a vulgar crowd of hungry cows.</p>
<p>It's not the fault of the creators; it's the essence of modernity.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg isn't a devil.</p>
<p>Heidegger wasn't just a grumpy old man.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, this is not a nihilistic post, there is one way out.</p>
<p>It's been there from the start, but ambition and talent may blind you agaisnt it.</p>
<p>Hate, greediness, envy, fear - these can't be the staves of an ever-thriving barrel.</p>
<p><br />I don't need a line of code to drink from the most genuine, intense and manifold barrel I've seen.</p>
<p>It's an universe within itself and I will never fully grasp its numberless peculiarities and possibilities.</p>
<p>I lay my eyes on it and there's always a small detail that changes, and intensifies, the greater story.</p>
<p>It changes, becomes stronger and, with authentic and loving staves, it'll perpetually astonish your mind.</p>
<p><br />To start with love, be authentic, is a humbling experience.<br />Yet, is the only way to experience the Infinite, to be Infinite yourself.</p>
