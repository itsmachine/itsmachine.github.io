  <h1> On giving</h1>
 <p>The greatest gift that God gives is not one of materiality, such as inheritance, luck, opportunities.</p>
<p>The greatest gift is, instead, the one gift of being.</p>
<p>Because, every person is package with pros and cons and, if one genuinely listens to one self, one could set itself free from all oppressions, lies, slavements.</p>
<p>Even so, no one is perfect and, as such, only find true harmony to be when the complementary soul enters into its path.</p>
<p>Is there a better definition of Love? Perhaps, but this is what I have today.</p>
<p>And what do I always wanted as a lover?</p>
<p>What could I have done?</p>
<p>For myself, I think true Love doesn't mean simply "giving".</p>
<p>Giving gifts, poems, hugs, kisses, cars, travels, money, or anything else.</p>
<p>Love truly is the building of a Truth and utopia that two hearts find to be the ideal.</p>
<p>I would never want to give you anything.</p>
<p>I would never want you to give me anything.</p>
<p>You are not seller, neither am I buyer.</p>
<p>Because we build together.</p>
<p>That's what I believe and always wanted.</p>
<p>I've seen too many cases of princesses locked in a castle of luxury, superficiality, gold, exorbitance and irrediamebly existential sadness.</p>
<p>I never wanted to just give you.</p>
<p>That's too easy and it's not the job of a lover.</p>
<p>The job of a lover is to set the other free.</p>
<p>And, as such, if I gave anything, it would be my future.</p>
<p>The future that I'd be willing to share only with you.</p>
<p>To be written not by my hands, but with our hands.</p>
<p>Not with my desires, but ours.</p>
<p>The castle I imagined, it doesn't matter how big or wealthy it is.</p>
<p>What matters is that this castle would be just as mine as yours.</p>
<p>Fruit of our work.</p>
<p>Fruit of our beliefs.</p>
<p>Fruit of our truths.</p>
<p>Fruit of our desires.</p>
<p>Fruit of our beings.</p>
<p>If I wasn't as able to build recently</p>
<p>To put bricks together</p>
<p>Is that</p>
<p>I can't do that with one hand</p>
<p>I may have the muscle</p>
<p>But sometimes</p>
<p>All I needed was the hand to motivate my ways.</p>
