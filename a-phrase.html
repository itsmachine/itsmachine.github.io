  <h1> A phrase</h1>
  <p>Yes, I was angry</p>
<p>I couldn't fully explain</p>
<p>Do you know what made me angry?</p>
<p>To see you living a life you don't deserve</p>
<p>To see how much you work</p>
<p>How many bad things you surround with</p>
<p>You are my pure angel</p>
<p>You are my definition of truth</p>
<p>And at the same time it came to my hear</p>
<p>I Remembered how lonely I feel</p>
<p>Remembered how I miss your eyes in the morning</p>
<p>Remembered how great your mere presence makes me feel amazing</p>
<p>Remembered that I now live in a place that I don't want</p>
<p>Remembered that the voices I hear in my house are not the one I want</p>
<p>And if we were just closer... together....</p>
<p>If we just had kept our hands closer....</p>
<p>If we had just lived a life together....</p>
<p>Everything would've been different</p>
<p>We would actually be happy, fullfilled,living true lives</p>
<p>It just made me angry to realize all of that,</p>
<p>You were always my propeller</p>
<p>And the more distant you were, the weaker I got</p>
<p>And now I'm just in ruins</p>
<p>I have literally nothing</p>
<p>It's in my mind. always</p>
<p>Everyday</p>
<p>Every minute and second</p>
<p>Since I met you</p>
<p>I wanted us to not be apart any longer</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>I wanted to see you everyday</p>
<p>Cook breakfast for you</p>
<p>I'd make you english cake every morning</p>
<p>I wanted us to be away from this city</p>
<p>From all this dirt, corruption, insanity</p>
<p>I didn't want to be the person you see once a week</p>
<p>I wanted to be your loved one</p>
<p>Your husband</p>
<p>I wanted you, our dogs and children to be the reason I wake up</p>
<p>And I would, everyday</p>
<p>And I would work unlike anyone you'd ever met</p>
<p>Even If I'd lost everything</p>
<p>I'd build all very quickly</p>
<p>I've done that already</p>
<p>I'd make us a factory of ninho candies</p>
<p>Build with you the best kernel of the country</p>
<p>And If all failed</p>
<p>I'd still be the best software person I am</p>
<p>Because I'd have done anything to build a future with you</p>
<p>To give you what you want</p>
<p>I just needed you</p>
<p>I don't need luxury, utopias, or anything</p>
<p>I only needed you close to me</p>
<p>I'd live in a small room with you</p>
<p>And from there build us a castle</p>
<p>That is all we always needed to get what we wanted</p>
<p>This is the reality</p>
<p>Together</p>
<p>We were always stronger</p>
<p>And I don't know about you</p>
<p>But apart</p>
<p>I always just fell apart</p>
<p>I know you made your mind</p>
<p>But I want to show you what I always wanted</p>
<p>I want to explain my anger, why i inconformed</p>
<p>It's because none of it would happen if we were together</p>
<p>If you'd believed in me</p>
<p>If you'd given me a chance</p>
<p>My greatest dream and utopia</p>
<p>Was to hear from you a good morning</p>
<p>Every single day</p>
<p>And from that</p>
<p>I'd have all the blessing I needed</p>
<p>Everything else in my life</p>
<p>All the troubles and mishappenings</p>
<p>Would be a small</p>
<p>Irrelevant detail</p>
	<p>If you had just really yes, took my hands and  joined me</p>
	<p>If you had just said "Let's get ourt of here right now"</p>
	<p>Even If you had let me stayed with in in your tiny house</p>
	<p>Even if you stayed with me in my tiny place downtown</p>
	<p>We could've been in a humble place, but we would be free</p>
	<p>From there, I know we would go far</p>
	<p>So far from here, we would find our place</p>
	<p>And that's why God connected our lives</p>
	<p>Because our beliefs, ideas and destiny is the same</p>
<p>There would be no disease to kill us</p>
<p>There would no barrier we couldn't cross</p>
<p>Our love was the greatest remedy, truth and meaning I ever got</p>
	<p>And now I have nothing</p>
	<p>Now I just wait for the doors of timelessness.</p>
