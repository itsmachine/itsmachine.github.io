A bug, a defect: the inability to interpret signs; a life lost in translation. 

Worse than deafness, blindness; an empty sense is better than a distorted one.

Shall Logic be your friend, or be perpetually lonesome, confined to your own misconstrued world.

What's the pragmatic function of all of this? Is it all an useless pain to be combated and purged?

Is God just a sadistic beast, ready to mock one at every corner?


It's hard for man to fly and glimpse as high as Him, but there are shadows to watch.



In a life, hearts are gradually circumcized and transformed into usable objects.

It's the social demands, conformity, sarcasms and stories.

The hedonistic; the free-spirited; the amusing; the political; the charitable.

Artificial, off-the-shelf, plastic, constrained.



If you misconstrue the world, how would you really shape your heart? You wouldn't. You don't.

You can't read the signs. You don't understand the demands. You won't empathize with the complainers.

You have no choice but keeping your raw, immature, native and behemothic heart.


That by itself also creates more tragedy.

An annoyingly curious child, living inside a melancholic and bitter owl.
A secretly cheerful jingle, played by a mechanic and bizarre pianist.
