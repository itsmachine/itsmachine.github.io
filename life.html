  <h1> Life</h1>
  <p>And now that he sleeps, I find the time and unescapable desire to reflect in thine bestowed magnificence.<br />It's almost incomprehensible, for a machine to understand, as the smile almost twitches and certainly crafts my face, for such silent, shy and tiny little creature to exist.<br />But it's not about the size, it's about Life.<br />And I'd never felt as surronded by, through, with Life.<br />All computers, books, clothes, foods, they stare at three of us, wondering, envying, but remaining always static.<br />Living is a singularity on space and time.<br />Life, if small or big, yellow or purple, quiet or funny, speaks louder.<br />Life always entices, amazes, embraces and dwarfs any Thing.<br />And that's why I'm gleaming, twinkling, flying.<br />For two decades, it was hard, almost impossible, to distinguish myself from a thing.<br />I had the wish, praying, craving, trying to embrace a tiny spot of Life, yet all I could find was the lonely, sharp, cold air.<br />In a dark night, She gave me a tiny fragment of that. And little by little, we gave each other little pieces of lives, colors, hope and light.<br />And today, being given such pure, genuine, beautiful Life, yet another big part of my heart was opened.</p>
<p>And, with that, I just know it.<br />I know how much you love me.<br />I know how much I love you.<br />I know how much we are blessed.<br />I know we can free each other.<br />I know how far we can fly.<br />I know we can do it all.<br />I know we are just getting started.<br />I know we will never going to stop.</p>
